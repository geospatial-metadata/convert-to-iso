# GeoData Web Documentation Preview

This is a preview including pending changes to the GeoData online documentation at [geodata.nal.usda.gov/help](https://geodata.nal.usda.gov/help)

The preview is provided to make updates publically available more quickly than the next scheduled website updata.
To view the preview web pages:
* download the zip file and unzip it on a local computer. 
* View the index.html file at the highest level in the unzipped folder structure.
  * That index.html file is likely to be a few folders below the folder into which the zip file was extracted to.
  * Please note: there are other HTML files at various lower levels. If you click on these other files, the documentation will open to the page corresponding to that file. From there you can still navigate through the rest of the documentation.
* Be sure to check back for changes to the Preview. 
  
If you have any suggestions for improvement/correction, please create a GitHub Issue in this repository with your feedback. If you refer to a particular page, please copy the full page URL so we can identify the location relevant to the suggestion. 

If you have content to contribute to the documentation, please contact the GeoData team. We are using the same tools and processes to create the GeoData documentation that are used by the underlying GeoNetwork open source system. The content is created in files in the ReStructuredText (.rst) format and processed by Spinx (Python) to produce the website.
