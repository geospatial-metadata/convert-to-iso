# geospatial-metadata

The goal is to provide resources that are useful for the creation and maintenance of the ISO 19115 family of geospatial metadata standards. The repositories will contain
* A compilation of existing materials
* Information developed to support colleagues using a localized version of GeoNetwork internally named GeoData
* Code
  * XML transforms to convert from other metadata standards to ISO
  * Batch processing for metadata creation
  * other topics as they evolve
