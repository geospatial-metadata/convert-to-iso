Resources for converting from other metadata standards/formats to ISO
* **CSDGM to ISO:** 
  * XML Transform from legacy FGDC Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata (CSDGM). CSDGM was commonly referred to as "FGDC metadata" when it was the only metadata standard they approved. Now that FGDC has endoresed ISO 19115 and other standards, "CSDGM" is the clearer name.
